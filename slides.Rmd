## My objective today to use spatial statistics to illustrate that:

- In the last 8 years, extreme political violence in Sudan has significantly reduced.
- However, the violence that remains is more concentrated in the west and southern parts of Sudan (the site of the Darfur genocide and the second Sudanese civil war).

## Map of political violence in Sudan, 2005 - 2020

- **Illustrates that in Sudan, high-grade or extreme political violence (i.e. armed conflict, forced disappearances/abductions/sexual violence) seems to decrease overtime**
- This map represents 20,000 instances of low to high-grade political violence in Sudan using the Armed Conflict Location Event Database (ACLED), a popular source of geopolitical information
- Each frame is 1 year, starting with 2005
- An average of 4 fatalities per event of these 20,000 events

## Can confirm this statistically (extreme violence has decreased in Sudan 2012 onward)

- From 2005 to 2011, we see hot spots of violence in the west and southern regions
- But from 2012 onwards, these hotspots tend to disappear

## Extreme violence has a spatial elements; some regions of Sudan have seen more violence than others

- Western Sudan is home to Darfur, the site of a genocide that started in 2002 and still has not ended
- Southern Sudan is partly where the second Sudanese civil war took place, and resulted in the creation of South Sudan in 2011
- Other regions of conflict: Two Areas (Blue Nile and South Kardofan)

- K function shows that point process underlying the distribution of extreme violence deviates from the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness to a statistically significant degree
